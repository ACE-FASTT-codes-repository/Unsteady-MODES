Tutorial for running AdaptiveMODES Offline-Online for the simple case of a symmetric airfoil.
The Adaptive Framework will be built using three methods, namely Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD),
Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Recursive Dynamic Mode Decomposition (RDMD)

Make sure you have the following executable
AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Offline
AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Online
SU2_DTR, SU2_SOL (you can download and install at https://github.com/ACE-FASTT-codes-repository/SU2-DualTimeResidual)


First step is the generation of the residual error database for the Adaptive Framework

- Create links to AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Offline and SU2_DTR in your working folder

- Run AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Offline as follows
		./AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Offline configfile-modes.cfg configfile-su2.cfg
		
  where configfile-modes is modesOffline.cfg and configfile-su2 is su2-NACA0012.cfg for this tutorial.
  history files will be generated for each method included in the Adaptive Framework, namely POD, DMD and RDMD 

- Make sure to rename each history file in the format history_method.csv (all small case).
  For example, history_POD_5_0.001.csv, which carries information about the number of modes and the discretization
  used for computing the dual time residual, should be renamed or linked as history_pod.csv
  
- Run AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Online as follows 
		./AdaptiveMODES_DTR_Online configfile-modes.cfg
  where configfile-modes is modesOnline.cfg for this test case
  
Target solutions, as specified in the config file, will be the output of the run and will be numbered from 0 up
to the number of target points specified in the configuration file (T_REC flag containing the list of the time instants
to reconstruct)

If you want to visualize the solution, PostProcess through SU2_SOL can be done, setting the available su2 config file properly 
(with correct names of file and mesh)
	./SU2_SOL su2config.cfg
vtk/dat files will be generated that can be visualized in paraview
